#******Build, Test and Deploy React and Java App******

###**Architecture Overview**
The architecture consists of a modern software development and deployment pipeline using Azure services. 
It enables developers to collaboratively develop, test, containerize, and deploy applications using Azure Repos, Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure DevOps pipelines.

##Tools & Techs:-
Cloud - Azure

CICD - Azure DevOps

Orchestration - Azure Container Registry(ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Programming - React and Java

##****Components:****
### 1) Azure Repos:
Azure Repos is a Git-based repository hosting service provided by Azure DevOps.
It serves as the central repository for storing and versioning source code, configurations, and other artifacts related to the application.

# 2)Azure Container Registry (ACR):
Azure Container Registry is a private registry service provided by Azure for storing and managing Docker container images.
It securely stores Docker images used by applications, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.
ACR integrates with Azure DevOps pipelines to automate container image builds and deployments.

# 3) Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
Azure Kubernetes Service is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by Azure.
It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration.
AKS provides a highly available and scalable platform for running containerized workloads.

# 4) Azure DevOps Pipelines:
Azure DevOps Pipelines is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) service provided by Azure.
It automates the build, test, and deployment processes for applications hosted on Azure Repos.
DevOps pipelines are configured to trigger on code commits, automatically building Docker images, running tests, and deploying to AKS.

##**Workflow:**
# 1)Development:
Developers collaborate on code changes using Azure Repos, following Git-based version control practices.
They commit code changes to feature branches and create pull requests for code review.

# 2) Continuous Integration (CI):
Upon code commits or pull requests, Azure DevOps Pipelines trigger CI workflows.
CI pipelines build Docker images from the application source code stored in Azure Repos.
Unit tests, integration tests, and other quality checks are executed to ensure code quality.

# 3) Containerization:
The built Docker images are tagged and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) for storage and versioning.
ACR serves as a central registry for Docker images, accessible to the deployment pipeline.

# 4) Continuous Deployment (CD):
After successful CI, CD pipelines are triggered to deploy the Docker images to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Kubernetes manifests define the desired state of the application, specifying deployment configurations, service definitions, and other resources.
AKS orchestrates the deployment of containerized applications, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

# 5) Monitoring and Observability:
Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights provide monitoring and observability capabilities for deployed applications.
They track application performance, monitor resource utilization, and provide insights into application health and availability.

##**Benefits:**
# 1) Scalability and Flexibility:
Leveraging Azure services enables scalable and flexible development and deployment workflows.

# 2) Automation and Efficiency:
Automation of build, test, and deployment processes improves efficiency and accelerates time-to-market.

# 3) Reliability and Resilience:
Using managed Azure services ensures reliability, resilience, and high availability of deployed applications.

# 4) Visibility and Insights:
Monitoring and observability tools provide visibility into application performance and health, enabling proactive issue resolution and optimization
